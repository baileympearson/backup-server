# backup-server
a collection of scripts used to remotely backup my laptop

Backs up my computer automatically to a server I maintain.  These serve
little-to-no purpose if you don't have a second computer available to run as a
server or if you don't know me.

## Install
	If you choose to set up a personal server, run the server_init.sh script and
follow the instructions in server/README.md
